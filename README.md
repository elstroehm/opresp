This is a small program for the computation of the optical response of a quantum 
mechanical system with known parameters subject to a trail of laser pulses, as 
encountered in multidimensional spectroscopy. To compile the code, one needs to link the corresponding libraries (Eigen3, Cuba, nlohmann/json, HDF5 library of 
the HDF5 group, boost) as found in the makefile.
